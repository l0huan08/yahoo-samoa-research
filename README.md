====================
This is my final project for master degree in University of Louisville. My reasearch is mainly focus on trying Yahoo SAMOA, a distributed stream data mining platform. I composite 3 computers in our lab into a cluster, and setup SAMOA on this cluster.

My main work includes four parts:
1.Build the cluster and Setup SAMOA
2.Experiment 1: Test performance of SAMOA
3.Experiment 2: Implement my own data mining algorithm (Non-Parallel Naive Bayes) on SAMOA
4.Experiment 3: Implement parallel Naive Bayes algorithm on SAMOA

The reports could be found in "White Papers" and "Lab". The presentations could be also found in "PPT".
